# Operations we want to support:
# - find next \r\n or \r\n\r\n (\n or \n\n are also acceptable),
#   or wait until there is one
# - read at-most-N bytes
# Goals:
# - on average, do this fast
# - worst case, do this in O(n) where n is the number of bytes processed
# Plan:
# - store bytearray, offset, how far we've searched for a separator token
# - use the how-far-we've-searched data to avoid rescanning
# - while doing a stream of uninterrupted processing, advance offset instead
#   of constantly copying
# WARNING:
# - I haven't benchmarked or profiled any of this yet.
#
# Note that starting in Python 3.4, deleting the initial n bytes from a
# bytearray is amortized O(n), thanks to some excellent work by Antoine
# Martin:
#
#     https://bugs.python.org/issue19087
#
# This means that if we only supported 3.4+, we could get rid of the code here
# involving self._start and self.compress, because it's doing exactly the same
# thing that bytearray now does internally.
#
# BUT unfortunately, we still support 2.7, and reading short segments out of a
# long buffer MUST be O(bytes read) to avoid DoS issues, so we can't actually
# delete this code. Yet:
#
#     https://pythonclock.org/
#
# (Two things to double-check first though: make sure PyPy also has the
# optimization, and benchmark to make sure it's a win, since we do have a
# slightly clever thing where we delay calling compress() until we've
# processed a whole event, which could in theory be slightly more efficient
# than the internal bytearray support.)
